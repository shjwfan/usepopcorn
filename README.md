`usepopcorn` is my pet project where I practice with `React`, `TypeScript`, and `Vite` (also I practice `Jest`), creating a website to help people choose movies to watch, I am creating this project through Jonas Schmedtmann's [the-ultimate-react-course Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course), but it's not a copy-paste. üçø
